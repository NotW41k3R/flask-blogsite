# Blogsite - Part 2 (Jinja2 + Flask Template Rendering + Bootstrap)

This part upgrades the basic blog app by adding Bootstrap for styling and Jinja templates for cleaner page layouts. The app still loads blog data from a remote JSON API, but now the pages look more organized and consistent.

The homepage shows all posts in a neat Bootstrap layout, and each one links to its own full post page. Extra pages like About and Contact are added to make the site feel more complete. Shared elements such as navigation and basic layout are handled through Jinja templates so the site stays easy to update.

Skills learned: using Bootstrap with Flask, building cleaner page layouts with Jinja, structuring multi page sites, and displaying API-loaded content with clean layouts, and applying responsive styling without JavaScript.
